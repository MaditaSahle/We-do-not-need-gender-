# We do not need gender!

To answer this question, we should start by making a distinction between sex and gender, because
even if gender is not a necessity, the categorization of people by their sex brings various benefits.
The main difference between sex and gender is how to know which sex or gender you are. If you
are part of the 99% of people who are born with a clear sex (indicated by the genitals), then you
can automatically be assigned a sex, which will affect some things in and on your body. This purely
is a matter of biological sex you are born with, which is more difficult to change. Therefore, sex is a
hard, difficult to change form, that is predetermined even before you are actually born. Gender, on
the other hand, you can choose for yourself. While sex can be recognized by looking at each
others body ÃÅs, gender can only be revealed through interaction or conversation. Therefore,
gender is the soft, easier changeable opposite of sex, which can be changed at will and without
great effort. The distinction between sex and gender here is made for a reason. While gender has
no natural, biological, hormonal or medical, influence on the body, sex has a great influence on
these very points. Even though the biological, hormonal and medical influences on the body are
interdependent, an attempt is being made to separate them for a better overview. It should also be
mentioned that these natural influences can be affected by hormone supplements or other medical
changes to the body.
The influencing factors mentioned are strongly interdependent, making it almost impossible to
separate them. Hormones have a strong influence on the body, since they can affect the way we
react to various influences, such as our environment or stress. They also have an impact on the
behavior and physical condition of the body, for example, testosterone tends to amplify
aggression in peoples behavior, which is often associated with a willingness to take risks and
neglect their own health. Though the influence hormones have on the body go much deeper than
that. Exemplary, the influence of biological factors such as the environment, dealing with stress or
a change in lifestyle or nutrients can cause genomic and epigenetic changes. These changes
combined with their physiological effects are different in men and women. The reason for this is
that DNA repair and epigenetic mechanisms are altered by sex hormones.
One field in which the differentiation between the sexes is a necessity is medicine. The cellular
distinctions have an influence on the tolerance and effect of medication as well as on the symptoms
of diseases. Since most of todays medical knowledge is based on aggregate data from male cells,
male animals or male bodies, there is hardly any treatment or medication that is specifically
designed for the female body and its needs. Furthermore, gender also has an influence on the
symptoms of diseases, it does not matter whether the illness is physical or psychological. A
relatively well-known example of this is the difference in symptoms between the sexes in the event
of a heart attack; while discomfort or pain in the chest are the most common symptoms in men, which
are associated with a heart attack, women tend to experience fewer symptoms associated with a
heart attack, such as shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting as well as back or jaw pain.
From a biological or medical point of view, it is simply impossible to abolish the sexes. Simply
because even if you do not feel comfortable with your own sex or gender of the remaining influence
of hormones and effectiveness of medication.
In regards to gender this differs completely. Since the cultural gender cannot take any biological,
hormonal or medical influences on the body, there is no valid reason that would speak against the
abolition of gender. Nevertheless, the idea of abolishing genders seems to receive no attention.
Likewise, many seem to be against breaking away from the binary genders. Some countries go as
far as to forbid gender reassignment such as Russia or Iran. In many societies they are frowned
upon or ignored, whether through an operation or by asking to be recognized as a different sex,
which makes it difficult to implement a gender abolition. Another reason for the difficulty of
abolishing gender is the construction of our previous society. The topic of gender always plays a
role, whether in fashion or in economy; in fashion, clothing is distinguished between "suitable for
women and for men". Although there are a few providers for unisex fashion, the problem remains.
The economy also has a great influence on how we perceive gender and which characteristics we
assign to them. An example of this can be the purchase of childrens toys. Toys that we would
assign to the male sex are for example dinosaurs or toy cars. However, we would probably buy
dolls or kitchen utensils for a child with a female sex. In this case the child is forced into certain
stereotypes by advertising, coloring of the toys and the decision of ourselves which gender the
child has. The same applies to adults. While razors for men are made in ducal black or blue tones,
womens razors are often bright and especially pink. The pink design of the products designated
for women is on the one hand a marketing strategy, but on the other hand another reason for the
stereotyping women in general, it is also a reason why many think women love the color pink. While
the problems listed represent barriers to be overcome, a world without gender does not seem
impossible.
But why should gender be eliminated in the first place? One reason for this is to avoid
stereotypes. This allows for a free development of personality, which is not limited by gender-
specific constraints. A girl is not placed in the section of pink sweaters and purple dresses when
shopping for clothes, but also has the option of buying a green shirt or a sweater with cars on it
without having to explain to her parents why she chooses not to wear girl colors; Nor is there any
need for justification when buying toys. Another reason that supports the abolition of gender is
sexual orientation. While more and more genders emerge in the debate about gender, so do
different sexualities emerge in the debate about sexual orientation. Which abolishing gender would
remedy as well; a person would no longer be heterosexual or homosexual, because without gender,
there would be no need to distinguish between loving male, female, and non-binary people. You
would choose your partner not purely according to gender, but according to personality and
appearance. Another advantage can be found in building toilets and changing rooms. Without
gender, there would be no need to divide womens and mens toilets. A unisex toilet would be
standard therefore no one would have to choose a gender and go to a toilet without being asked,
"Are you right in the ladies' room?". The same goes for changing rooms and showers in swimming
pools or sports locker rooms in schools. Naming would also be simplified; while in other countries,
such as the US, naming is very open and with few restrictions, in other countries, such as
Germany, there are clear rules on naming. For instance, the name must indicate precisely whether
the child is female or male. It is not possible to give a girls name to a boy. Without gender, this
would not be a problem, because if there are no genders, no name for a particular gender can be
forbidden.
In conclusion one can say that the distinction between sex and gender is necessary. While sex is
determined by genetics, people choose their own gender. Sex should not be a pretext for a
gender system, but cannot be eliminated, because a persons biological differences must be known
in medicine in order to ensure proper and effective treatment. Abolishing gender would have a
positive impact on the personal development of society. Moreover, the debate about how many
genders there are and whether they make sense is no longer necessary. It also simplifies the choice
of life partners, as decisions are no longer made on the basis of gender, but purely on the basis of
personality and appearance. While abolishing sex is not possible, abolishing gender is feasible.
Nevertheless, difficulties remain. The greatest difficulty is to rethink society, because only society
as a whole can abolish stereotypes and therefore gender.
